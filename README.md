# Nouvelle Terre
La Nouvelle Terre, as they call it, is the product of a divergence between our two timelines. We went down the path of the old world, where we saw two worldwide wars before finally admitting our wrongdoings and creating international organisations to maintain stability. For clarity, we will refer to it as the Old Earth.

However, the path this world went down was one of perpetual war and authoritarianism, where the world is forever stuck in its delusions of “rightful” acts, glory in war and heroes. A world where the word “salvation” doesn’t hold meaning. A world where money is the language.
